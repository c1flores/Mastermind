## Overview

This repository contains the Python code for a command-line terminal game of Mastermind. Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game where one player creates a secret code and the other player tries to guess the code within a limited number of attempts.

## What is Mastermind?
Mastermind was created by an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert, Mordecai Meirowitz, in 1970. Initially known as "Bulls and Cows," the game gained popularity under the name "Mastermind" after it was published by the Dutch company Invicta Games. Since then, it has become a beloved classic and has been adapted into various formats, including electronic versions and computer games.
